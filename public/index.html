                <p>Very good service - polite, friendly, considerate and efficient. Arrived on time, cleared everything required, left house tidy (hoovered) when they left. Exactly what you need in these circumstances! Thanks.</p>

                <p>The amazing Baz! I called him to dispose of my sofas. He said they were to good to dump and contacted a friend of his who recycles sofas supporting a charity in Ghana. Baz said he would forego making his money when the sofas could be used elsewhere. It&#39;s not often you find an honest superstar like him. What a man!</p>
