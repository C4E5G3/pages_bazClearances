Dorset House Clearance
We have many long-term clients in and around Dorset, as well as further afield, who we have been helping to clear properties and move goods for for several years. One trusted client would only consider us when it came to moving an extremely expensive antique table, and another entrusts us to move specialist items worth five or even six figures. Actually, in his own words, he regards us the &lsquo;white glove delivery service&rsquo;, because of the level of
service we provide. But our reputation is not just anecdotal, you can read our reviews at any time, just check our

<h3 id="our-backstory">Our Backstory</h3>
<p>Over the last few years I have been given sporadic jobs from friends and acquaintances where they have asked me to move bits and bobs, or on occasion, perform a total house clearance. People that know me well know that I am reliable and that I am &ldquo;the man for the job&rdquo;. So back in 2022, myself and Marcus decided to bite the bullet and start a house clearance business in Dorset. We did some preliminary marketing and set up a provisional website, (with of course the
obligatory teething problems), but since the summer of 2023 we have started to get calls, and have now been up and running properly for about 6 months. We are based in Ferndown on the outskirts of Bournemouth, and we serve the whole of Dorset, as well as Hampshire and parts of Somerset and Wiltshire. (In fact, given that the preponderance of Dorset&rsquo;s inhabitants reside in Bournemouth and Poole, we originally tried to brand ourselves as <strong>House Clearance Bournemouth</strong> but Ferndown where we are based does not count as Bournemouth, in the eyes of the algorithms, and thus we now identify as a 
<a href="https://bazclearance.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dorset House Clearance Company</a>. Such are the travails of marketing and ranking in 2024. However!! We are five miles from Bournemouth and Poole so we really are particularly well-positioned and very much available for house clearances in Bournemouth, {and house clearances in Poole}).</p>

<h3 id="in-the-community">In The Community</h3>
<p>This business is extremely important to myself and Marcus. Having lived many years in London, we enjoy being part of a less impersonal and more friendly society. Dorset is
an area we cherish, and we value our community ties. A lot of our work so far has been born of or involved our local network of contacts and friends. For instance, a friend of my wife&rsquo;s
from the local church runs a local charity shop, and so we have a dynamic relationship which allows me to drop in on him with bundles of clothing and other items,
which is a great way for me to recycle all sorts of things which have not completed their lifecycle. As I am extremely well-connected in the region, if someone
gives me a random problem, (say: &ldquo;can you get rid of these two sofas for me?&rdquo;), I am more than likely to have a solution to hand, I will likely know someone who is looking
for two sofas at that time.</p>

<p>The first point of contact is a phone call or email - you just get in touch and we go from there. One of us will come round and assess the job. Unlike a lot of companies,
we factor into the quotation re-sellable goods and can offer you something for them. Given that we have finite storage space and have to shift things pronto, we cannot expect to get the full value for an item, but we certainly take into account things of value when giving you a quote. (There are of course occasions where, for
whatever reason, we cannot sell something, and it has to be given away, or disposed of - so our quotes take all these factors into account). Anyhow, that is our first point of contact. We will quote you for the job, pencil in when
we would be able to do it, (or, if you need the job done further down the line, you would advise us of when you would need the job doing), and then we leave our quote with you. Hopefully you will come
back to us.</p>

<p>If you like the quote, then we will do the job as agreed. You can either be on the premises, or agree to meet us with the keys, normally at 8:00 AM, so that we can gain
entry and go to work. We use unmarked vans so as not to draw attention to the fact that there may be an uninhabited property. We work in a discreet and professional way,
and we mandate courtesy and good manners in all of our staff. In terms of the actual work, the key priorities are to effect it quickly and efficiently, without
degrading your property. If working until 8 or 9PM is necessary in order to finish a job, we will do this, if you need speedy access for whatever reason.</p>

                 <p>Baz made a great job in clearing out my mother&#39;s house. Very tidy work at a reasonable price taking care not to damage the paintwork.</p>

                 <p>The amazing Baz! I called him to dispose of my sofas. He said they were to good to dump and contacted a friend of his who recycles sofas supporting a charity in Ghana. Baz said he would forego making his money when the sofas could be used elsewhere. It&#39;s not often you find an honest superstar like him. What a man!</p>

<p>We work with all sorts of people, and one common theme around clearing a house is that it often involves
a death or an elderly person moving into some kind of formal care, or both. These situations can be traumatic
and challenging for some people, and, if for instance you have been made executor of an estate and you live
on the other side of the country, they can be a practical headache also. We have dealt with our fair share of
such problems in our own lives, so we hope we can be understanding of and sympathetic to your problems and challenges in such situations.
More often than not you want a problem solved quickly and painlessly, which is our remit. Of course end of life problems is not the only
scenario; people need houses cleared for all sorts of reasons, some banal like the end of a tenancy, some more emotive, like a
departure or a broken relationship. Whatever the reason, we are respectful of your personal feelings, your privacy, and
your need to advance in your life with minimal inconvenience.</p>
